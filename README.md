# Unity-Pong

This is a recreation of the famous Pong game created in Unity with some variations, like the style, of the game or the way that it is played.

## Content

The user can play against the machine or against another player from the same device. In addition, within the difficulty, there are different types of AI levels:

- **Easy**: The machine will be a little slower than the player and will not move as much towards the ball.
- **Normal**: The machine will go at the same speed as the player and follow the path of the ball.
- **Hard**: The machine will go faster than the player and predict the direction of the ball.

The game will have different themes, which will only change the way the field looks, but will not change the way the game is played. Some of these styles are as follows: 

- **Classic**: Attempts have been made to recreate the original style of Pong.
- **Classic Pro**: Based on the classic mode, objects will have more visually appealing materials and effects.
- **...**

The player will be able to see his statistics at any time, to know the number of games played, the number of victories, ratios, etc.

## Other annotations

The game is in both Spanish and English.
